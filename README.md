# NodeMCU Clock with Temperature , Hijri Date and Prayer Time

A real time clock with the ability to show Gregorian date, Hijri date, Daily prayer times, Temperature (celsius and fahrenheit) and greeting messages on special days. No RTC module is used; instead it gets current accurate time from NTP service (pool.ntp.org). Similarly it doesn't use any temperature sensor module but fetches current outside temperature information from the openweathermap.org website.
