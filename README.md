# NodeMCU Clock with Temperature , Hijri Date and Prayer Time

No RTC module is used; instead it gets current accurate time from NTP service (pool.ntp.org) . Similarly it doesn't use any temperature sensor module but fetches current outside temperature information from the openweathermap.org website.
